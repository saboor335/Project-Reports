In women, breast cancer is the most common type of cancer. The World Cancer Research Fund International says that diagnosing these conditions in time either benignly or malignantly significantly increases the chances of successful treatment and survival. Here's where data science can Diagnosing a breast pathology in time, either benign or malignant, is extremely important since it significantly increases the chances of successful treatment and survival rate. This is where data science comes can help.
Through the use of data mining algorithms and machine learning algorithms, it is now possible to predict the risk of breast cancer, detect any anomalies at an early stage, estimate its dynamics, and thus devise an optimal strategy for preventing it.I think it can be classified as a typical machine learning problem.
The main issue with using such datasets in classifiers is that they can be strongly imbalanced. For example, in the case when the outcome is represented in a form of cancer / no cancer, the probability of having a pathology (those dataset entries that belong to the minority class) is considerably lower than the probability of not having any pathology (the entries belonging to the majority class). As a result, the algorithm tends to classify new cases as non-pathological ones. Hence, for assessing the accuracy of such models more efficiently, it makes sense to apply the F1-score as an evaluation metric, since it estimates false positives (type I error) and false negatives (type II error) rather than the cases when the algorithm classified the entries correctly.
